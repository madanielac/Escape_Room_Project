# CS 151-03 FINAL PROJECT: Escape Room Game


The Classroom.py program in addition to Click.py, Clues.py, Key.py, Play.py, Turns.py, graphics.py, and loginFP.py executes the interactive multiplayer Escape Room game through a graphics window.

- Click.py allows the program to know where the player is clicking 

- Clues.py provides the text of the clues 

- Key.py is the final question to answer in order to meet the conditions required to end the game

- Play.py operates the play of the game, starting and ending it

- Turns.py controls the multiplayer asset of the game and makes sure that turns rotate between players

- loginFP allows different user interfaces to be created

The user plays the game by clicking objects in the room and using the instructions given by each to proceed to the next clue and then ultimately the final clue which allows the user to escape the room. The final clue uses information from each of the other clues. 

This game was designed with the intent to incorporate basic Python knowledge into an easy and fun game that strengthens the players grasp of Python vocabulary.

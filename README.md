# CS 151-03 FINAL PROJECT: Escape Room Game


The Classroom.py program in addition to Click.py, Clues.py, Key.py, Play.py, Turns.py, click.py, graphics.py, and loginFP.py executes the interactive multiplayer Escape Room game through a graphics window.

The user plays the game by clicking objects in the room and using the instructions given by each to proceed to the next clue and then ultimately the final clue which allows the user to escape the room. The final clue uses information from each of the other clues. 

This game was designed with the intent to incorporate basic Python knowledge into an easy and fun game that strengthens the players grasp of Python vocabulary.
